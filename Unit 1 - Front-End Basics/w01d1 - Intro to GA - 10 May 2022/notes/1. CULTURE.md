## Communication Tools

### Slack
	- sg-seif-3

#### 4 channels

	- TBD

#### How To:

##### Communicate in one of the outrun channels:

	- @username
		- sends a notification to a specific user
	- @channel / @here
		- sends a notification to everyone / everyone currently online
    - DO NOT use these unless absolutely necessary (usually only instructors/ta's use this)

##### Communicate privately:

- Direct messages are one-on-one messages nobody else can see.
- In addition, you can make group direct messages to talk to multiple people at once, privately.

##### Other:

	- You can mute channels that you no longer need (Fundamentals)
	- You can adjust the sound / notifications of your messages

### Zoom

Our video conferencing tool!

- We use breakout rooms for group meetings
- Don't forget to mute!
- You can share your screen with us / anyone
