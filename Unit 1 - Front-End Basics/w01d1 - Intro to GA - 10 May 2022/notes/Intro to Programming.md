# Intro to Programming in 5 minutes

## Lesson Objectives

_After this lesson, students will be able to:_

1. Define programming and why we're learning it
2. Understand the intuition of programming
3. Understand the intuition of different elements of programming

## Define programming and why we're learning it

### What is Programming?

`Programming is writing instructions for computers, so that computers can follow the instructions to complete useful tasks.`

### What is Programming language?

`Just like human to human communication, programs('instructions') can be written in different programming languages. In order for computers to complete the intended tasks, programs also need to be correct (both syntax and semantics).`

## Understand the intuition of programming

### How do we use a calculator?

`Press '1 + 1' and press 'Enter'. Then '2' is displayed.`

Here in order to complete the task of adding, we need to: 

1. represent information. ie. number 1
2. process information. ie. adding numbers 1 + 1

`Programming is a lot similar. But we have much more ways to 'represent' and 'process' information.`

## Understand the intuition of different elements of programming


**Variables and Data types**

* To represent different kind of information effectively, we need different data types. eg. "General" and 1 are of different data types.
* Information can be saved into variables so that it's easier to reference later on. eg. var name = "mike";

**Operators**

* eg. '+' to add numbers.

**Control Flow, If-else, Loops**

* If-else: We need to run certain tasks conditionally. eg. log user in if password is correct
* Loops: We need to repeat certain tasks multiple times. eg. keep on playing my video until it's finished.

**Functions**

* We need to group instructions as 1 task, so that they could be re-used, just like save a recipe so that you could share it with your friends.

`No matter what programming languages, these are the big ideas we need to learn to program.`
