## Important!
For all the following questions, please write all using the following loops (yes, each question will have the solution for all 3):
    - while loop
    - do-while loop
    - for loop

## Q1: Chessboard
Write a program that create a string that represents an 8Ã—8 grid, using newline characters to separate lines. At each position of the grid there is either a space or a "#" character. The characters should form a chessboard.

Passing this string to console.log should show something like this:

```
 # # # #
# # # #
 # # # #
# # # #
 # # # #
# # # #
 # # # #
# # # #
```

## Q2: Fizz Buzz
This is a classic problem that you should get really comfortable solving. If you've solved it before, try to make it more elegant.

Write a javascript application that logs all numbers from 1 - 100.

- If a number is divisible by 3 log "Fizz" instead of the number.
- If a number is divisible by 5 log "Buzz" instead of the number.
- If a number is divisible by 3 and 5 log "FizzBuzz" instead of the number.
