# <span><img src="../../../ga_cog.png" width="30" height="30" style="vertical-align: middle;"></span> Create a page with any API data source

Note: This is a bonus exercise & not compulsory

## Objective: Create a page with any API data source

## Setup

1. Create 3 files:
  - index.html
  - index.js
  - index.css
2. Link `index.js` & `index.css` to `index.html`
3. You can use any UI framework that you want (or just write the CSS by hand) like Bootstrap

## Expectation

This exercise gives you free reign to use your creativity to use any free API to create your page.

You can style the page however you want. The main thing is that we can see you use `fetch` to fetch data from an API endpoint, process the response data and display the data onto the page.
