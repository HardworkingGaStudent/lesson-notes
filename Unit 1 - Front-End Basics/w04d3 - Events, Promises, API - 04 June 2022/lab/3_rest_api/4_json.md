## What is JSON

JSON: Javascript Object Notation.

JSON is the most commonly used format for sending & requesting data through REST API. As per its name, it looks almost exactly like a Javascript Object. The only difference is that the both property & value must be enclosed within double quotes

```json
{
  "property1": "value1",
  "property2": "value2",
  "property3": "value3"
}
```
