## Code wise
1. Use `const` to declare everything until you face an error. Then change to `let`.
2. **NEVER EVER** use `var`.
3. Always use `===` unless you are 100% sure you intend to use `==`.
4. Javascript convention is `camelCase`
5. CSS convention is `kebab-case`
6. Aim to always use semantic HTML
7. Never use `id` in your HTML unless you intend to access it specifically using Javascript
8. Write your CSS using css classes & aim for reusability instead of specificity
9. Always refer to [caniuse](https://caniuse.com/) to check if a CSS property is usable in which browser & its version

## Mindset
1. Don't just check your local code. Check the PR for issues. The PR reflects the exact code that will be going to production.
2. Importance of exit tickets. I review everything and it is from there I will be able to make things better for you guys as a whole
3. Pay attention to reviews. I tend to mention once. It is on you to ensure your entire code reflects the review
4. This course is not meant to be easy. It is `hard`. Especially for this unit. Please take your time to fully understand all the concepts taught. Do not rush. Having a solid foundation will get you ready for any & all challenges that will come to you later.
5. Programming is a `creative work`. Programmers come together to build a masterpiece. To build a masterpiece, details matter. This means paying attention to everything including the mundane stuff.

## Challenge
For those who find that this unit is easy for you, I have the following challenges for you:

- Aim to get your PR approved without any comment to any issues
- Use a separate git branch when creating the PR
- I promise I will review everything you submit. So, search for questions online on the same subject and try it out. I will review & leave my comments
