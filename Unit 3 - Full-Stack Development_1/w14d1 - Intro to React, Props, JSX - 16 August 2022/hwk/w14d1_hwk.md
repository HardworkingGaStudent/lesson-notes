# 1. What is a Single-Page Application (SPA)?
	It is an application entirely loaded on a single HTML page. Only components need to be reloaded with new data, not the entire web page

# 2. What is a Multi-Page Application (MPA)?
	It is an application where every new request visits a new web page - the entire HTML page is being reloaded

# 3. When we built our Unit 2 apps, were they a SPA or MPA, why?
	Unit 2 is MPA because each new render refers to an entirely new HTML page that needs to be reloaded

# 4. Give two pros of a SPA
	1. It's more resource efficient, and lightweight as majority of the page need to be loaded only once - only the components need to be reloaded. 
	2. Development is much faster and easier because only components need to worked on, instead of entirely new pages (reusable components)

# 5. Give two cons of a SPA
	1. Heavy client frameworks need to be loaded, so it's slower to download
	2. It's also less secure due to Cross-site Scripting (XSS), where attackers can inject client side scripts into web application by other users

# 6. Give two pros of a MPA
	1. It's better for Search Engine Optimization (SEO) Management. There ise better chances to rank for different keywords
	2. Scaling is also easier as developers can create as many new pages as they want

# 7. Give two cons of a MPA
	1. It runs more slowly because the entire HTML needs to be re-rendered with each different route
	2. Development would also take longer as to integrate the FE and BE

# 1. What were the three great technical accomplishments of MPL?
	1. It created a new login system that was cheaper and faster than the older one
	2. The application was mobile responsive, and allowed all types of screens
	3. Users were able to submit documents more quickly
